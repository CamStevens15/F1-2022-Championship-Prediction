#### Introduction

This is a Supervised Machine learning Classification project using Pandas, Scikit-learn, and seaborns/matplotlib in Python to forcast formula 1 points for the up coming season.

#### What is Formula 1

Formula 1 or otherwise known as F1 is the pinnacle of international single seater motorsport racing; Sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and owned by the Formula One Group. The Fomula 1 World CHampionship, has been the ultimate forms of racing around the world. The FIA provides a technical rule books which governs in how the racing cars perform and opperate. The Championship is broken down into 23 races from around the world. The Formula One cars are the fastest regulated road-course racing cars in the world, owing to very high cornering speeds achieved through the generation of large amounts of aerodynamic downforce. The cars underwent major changes in 2017,[3] allowing wider front and rear wings, and wider tyres, resulting in peak cornering forces near 6.5 lateral g and top speeds of up to approximately 370 km/h (230 mph).[4][5]


With the annual cost of running a mid-tier team—designing, building, and maintaining cars, pay, transport—being US$120 million,[5] With this type of financial pressure, there comes pressure to perform. large investments from sponsors and budgets (in the hundreds of millions for the constructors). On 23 January 2017 Liberty Media confirmed the completion of the acquisition of Delta Topco, the company that controls Formula One, from private-equity firm CVC Capital Partners for $8 billion.[6] Often team and driver sponsorship correlates highly with track performance and ultimately track time.

#### Project Overview 

This projects goal is directed to understanding the data of past Fromula 1 races to predict the upcoming season races with the use of Supervised Machine learning. Currently classification models have been used which have shown the greatest predictive power for points and podiums. However, for future considerations a Neural Network, along with Regressional models to include weather to potentially increase increase predictive power.

#### Requirements

projects run on Python 3.7.0
